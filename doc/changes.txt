* droll; overloaded function to take 2 int args for xdx

July 9, 2002 - July 10, 2002

* Made subdirs for different kinds of files.
* Made consts to replace config.dat and initgame

March 27-28, 2003

* Started to split source files into different categories: character, monster, encounter, map, etc.
* Began constructing new items.


Things to do:

* Make graphics for the monsters
* Allow players to choose their picture
* $ picks pockets in the Elf Skull Inn
* Add new items: Magical Armor, Two-Handed Sword
* ! in Equip Shop and response to shopkeeper "JD3" gives special items
* # in Eagle Talon Inn and response to Tantala "JP4" gives full hp
* use bmp files
* split into directories
* convert graphics to OpenGL
* add bmp support
* add mouse support

Remember:

* When adding new things or changing certain stats, make sure to update in restore.pas and all applicable utilties (ChCreate if you're adding an item/spell, etc.)

Pascal RPG is an attempt to turn a game I wrote using Turbo Pascal 6.0 into a more usable RPG.  The reason I would like to use SourceForge is so that people who would also be interested in the project may put some time into it since it has been very slow going.  Particularly, I think there are very few Pascal projects out there, and I think this one may attract a certain niche.  I will contact the pascal-l mailing list (Yahoo!) about working on this if the project gets accepted by SourceForge.

The most difficult goal of the project will be rewriting the graphics of the game in order to support OpenGL instead of Borland's traditional Graph Unit syntax.  Since this is a difficult task, I have been working on a couple of other areas:  improving item, monster, and character statistics.  Further goals will be to add classes/races, create a different magic system, and provide modifiable "events" that can occur during the game.  One of the most glaring issues with the game is the lack of graphic art.  I hope that someone will draw pictures for the game after the OpenGL is implemented.

This is an RPG game written in Pascal (using Free Pascal).  It is based on the source code of a GPL'ed game called Ice Queen, another RPG written in Pascal.  The goal of this project is to expand Ice Queen to include new features, and most of all to improve the graphics.  Futhermore, the game will be geared somewhat towards a game engine--making it a tool to create multiple games.  Right now, Ice Queen runs primarily under DOS, but Pascal RPG's target OS is going to be primarily Linux, and then ported from Linux to other OS's.
