In this short game, you seek to defeat the Ice Queen who has created an eternal winter over the land.

Ice Queen is a home-made tile-based role-playing game inspired by Phantasie II for the Atari ST.  It was originally created around 1995 using Turbo Pascal 6.0 in a 16-color palette.  The latest updates provide for compiling using FreePascal on either Windows or Linux (and maybe others) using SDL.
