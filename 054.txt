You see someone fingering a copper coin inlaid with
different colored gems.  He tosses the coin around a bit.

You approach him asking about the coin.  ''It's none of
your business,'' he answers.  However, he buys you a
drink.  You find out his name is Drolen, and you sit and
chat with him.  He has stolen many a goods in the elven
city of Elfhome.
