To run Ice Queen from DOS or Windows: run icequeen.exe

Note: Ice Queen is the GPL license.  You can find a copy of this license in the file called 'LICENSE'.

If you need a free compiler, look for the Free Pascal Compiler at
http://www.freepascal.org/

Different compilers have different sized data types.  This program opens files of record types and reads/writes them.  If you get a disk reading error, try compiling and running the "default" utility which recreates all of those files.
