The Wilderness
</font>

<blockquote>
     The wilderness is a dangerous place with wandering monsters everywhere.  Some are weak and some are strong, so you need to choose your battles wisely.  In the wilderness you have a similar set of options as in town, however you cannot save the game here.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
     Towards the south is Gilantry City; towards the north is the Ice Castle where the Ice Queen resides.  It is cold and desolate.  Towards the west is a mysterious cave, and just northeast of Gilantry City is a lonely inn, the Elf Skull Inn.  Build up strength and money before trying to venture into the cave, and especially before entering the Ice Castle.
