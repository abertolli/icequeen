<blockquote>
     The game starts in the City of Gilantry.  You can visit different places while in Gilantry by selecting the number on the door, or you can press space and look at the Options Menu.  The various places to visit include the Weapon Shop, the Magic Shop, the Inn, and the Pub.  But more importantly, in town is the only place where you can save the game.  Saving the game often is important, because if you die you will have to start from the last point you saved.
