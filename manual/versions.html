VERSIONS
</font>

<blockquote>
v1.0:  The original project.  The code and program itself is lost as far as I know.  Basically it had an old version of the menu screens, and was created using my own system of attack scores vs defense scores.  Other than older menu screens, the original title of the game was "The Castle of the Winds," but was changed when I found out another game took the name.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
v1.1:  The demo version that is available.  The code to this is also gone.  It has improved menu screens for town and wilderness options.  There seems to be a bug when encountering monsters.  It crashes sometimes, probably on a particular monster.  Version 1.0 and 1.1 do not allow access to the Castle or the Cave.

<blockquote>
v2.0:  Changed over to D&D numbers and stats.  Improved the "view stats" screen.  And most of all, you can actually go up levels starting in 2.0.  Not only that but your character has more stats such as experience, levels, THAC0, etc. some to replace Combat Skill and Luck from the older versions.  There is a "Character Converter" program to convert the characters from one to the other.  Unfortunately, no one is able to keep the "Obliterate" spell if they obtained it.  No more unlimited spells.  The player must buy the Ring of Power that already contains the spell Power and one charge.  Each time the player recieves a new spell, it is enchanted into the ring, and another charge is added.  Changed the look of the swamp tile, cave tile, and inn tile.  New combat system with new monster stats.  The wandering monsters are rolled against a chart which is now contained in a file.  And this file points to where the monster file is.  Configuration settings are kept in config.dat and tell the system which files to use for maps, special encounters, and random monster encounters.
