LOAD/SAVE GAME
</font>

<blockquote>
The default file for loading or saving a game is "game.sav" (without any input, the computer defaults to this file).  This saved game is set by Icequeen defaults when you get the game.  It contains a rather good character named "Landon" on level 2 with more equipment and money than you get get starting your own.  You might want to play Landon for a while to get used to the game.  Starting with your own character, you will start at level 1 and have to buy your own equipment.
