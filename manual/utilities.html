<blockquote>
chcreate.exe:  This is a cheat program.  Delete it immediately!!!  (I hear you saying, "Yeah, right.")  This program was not originally intended to be available to the public, but you may have found it.  It is used to create any character you want, determining the stats yourself, etc.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
mncreate.exe:  Another cheat program.  (See above.)  This allows you to create monsters.  You save the monster stats into a file, and this file is referenced by a wandering monster chart file.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
mnview.exe:  This programs allows you to view the stats of any given monster file.  I guess this would be cheating too.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
mnchart.exe:  Yet ANOTHER cheat program.  This program creates a file containing a chart to roll random monster encounters.  For example, the Icequeen program looks for wandering monsters in the wilderness by going to the wild.dat file (the file which contains the chart for the wilderness encounter).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
mnchartv.exe:  Displays the contents of a wandering monster chart file.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
convert.exe:  Converts a character from the old demo format to the new format.  You should use this if you want to use your old character.  Do not try to cheat by tampering with old character files, because you will be penalized.

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
mpcreate.exe:  Allows you to adjust the map and code values for the maps in the game.  Map values contain what the map square looks like.  Code values contain what the map square actually does/is.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
mpview.exe:  Allows you to view the stats of a map by entering the .map and .cod files.  Every "map" has a map file and a code file.  For example, the files for the surface are surface.map and surface.cod.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
config.exe:  A configuration program which changes which files Icequeen gets information from (eg. wandering monster charts).
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
default.exe:  After tampering with all these files, you might want to put things back to normal.  This program recreates any of the above monsters, charts, maps, and configuration you might have changed.  Furthermore it will restore game.sav to it's original character, so be careful.  It WILL NOT recreate all the files for the game, however, so don't just go around deleting files.
