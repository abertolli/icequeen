Gaining Levels
</font>

<blockquote>
     When you have enough experience you will gain a level automatically.  You will not be warned, but your stats will change.  You gain endurance, the ability to hit creatures, the ability to dodge special attacks, etc.  As a rule, if there's a monster in the game you can't beat, it's because you're not on high enough level.  At higher levels, this game begins to become extremely easy (that's why you start at level 1).  However, as your level increases, it is increasingly harder to get to the next one.  You should be able to beat the game around levels 5 to 7.
