Weapons and Armor
</font>

<blockquote>
     When you have weapons and armor in your possession, you automatically weild the best of what you have.  In general, the more it costs, the better it is.  So take note of your damage, THAC0, and AC when you get new items, they will change automatically.

Potions
</font>

<blockquote>
     Potions are sold at the Magic Shop in town.  You can use these during battle or in the wilderness.  However, effects other than healing do not last very long, so certain potions should be saved for combat.
<br>
<br>Blue:  Increases Strength and Dexterity for a short period of time.
<br>
<br>Red:  Offers a few points of healing (best for low levels).
<br>
<br>Green:  A complete heal, and super charges Strength and Dexterity.

Spells
</font>

<blockquote>
     There might be ways to gain knowledge of other spells than just those you can learn at the shop, however these are the most common.
<br>
<br>Power:  This unusual spell is random, doing weird and chaotic things.
<br>
<br>Call Wild:  This spell calls the aid of the wildlife around you.  Obviously it works in outdoor settings the best, though it's usefulness is questionable.
<br>
<br>Courage:  This spell makes the caster more courageous, giving him a greater ability to hit and do damage.
<br>
<br>Web:  This spell sticks to a creature, making it almost impossible for it to make attacks normally.
<br>
<br>Heal:  This spell heals the caster somewhat.
<br>
<br>Fire Blast:  This spell hits a single creature with a blast of fire.  The power of this spell increases as the caster increases in level.

The Ring of Power
</font>

<blockquote>
     The ring is sold at the magic shop (the second door on the left in town).  When you buy a ring, it will come with the spell Power and one charge.  Whenever you are taught a new spell, it is put into your ring and you gain another charge.  This is the usual way to gain charges.  Any spell you use, takes one charge from your ring.  When all your charges are gone, you will need to give the ring one day to recharge itself (sleep at an inn).

OOPS!!  I hit the wrong key!
</font>

<blockquote>
     "I accidently selected (s)ell an item, but there isn't an item I want to sell!  That's okay, just go through the prompts.  Before it does anything, you'll be asked if you're sure if you want to sell it.  Just say (n)o.  This is also for accidently selecting an item you don't want to buy, etc.
