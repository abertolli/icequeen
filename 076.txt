at the pages.  The writing is like nothing you've ever seen
before, but somehow you are able to read it.  It is very
interesting...




   As you are reading, you don't notice that your body is
changing.  Before you know it, you have been turned into a
gold fish.  You flop around on the floor, feeling very dry.
You hope someone comes to put you in some water... but no
one does.
