   A chilling breeze comes from the north, reminding you of
the recent course of events.

   You remember when the cold came about one month after
spring started.  At first no one did more than complain
about the inconvenient weather.  But soon it became evident
that there was something wrong.  A dry cold had set over
the City of Gilantry.

   It seems that only the City was affected and farmers were
still able to grow their crops.  However, it didn't take long
for disease and depression to set in among the people.

   Later it was realized that a great Winter was approaching
from the north.  You know the cause of these happenings all
too well...



   You are summoned by the Council of Wizards.  Most of them
are stricken with disease and unable to meet you.  The young
Gandalph still looks well and he greets you.  "As you know," he
begins, "we have been experiencing an extended cold spell.
We believe it to be a work of magic."  And then he confirms
your suspicions, "We suspect this to be the work of the Ice
Queen."  The term brings back memories of your triumph
over the Ice Queen so many years ago.  "Since you have
battled her before, we now ask for your help in defeating the
Ice Queen and saving this noble city from her raging blizzard
that now approaches from the north."



   Of course, being the great person you are, you accept
the mission and the reward.  What reward?  Why fame and
glory of course!  Not to mention the reward that comes with
it.
