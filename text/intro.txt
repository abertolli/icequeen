   A chilling breeze comes from the north, reminding you of
the recent course of events:

   A bitter cold descended on the City of Gilantry about one
month after spring had started.  At first no one did more
than complain about the inconvenient weather.  But after weeks
passed, it soon became evident that there was something wrong.

   It seemed that only the city had been affected, and farms
to the south were still able to grow crops.  However, it
wasn't long before disease and depression began to afflict the
people.

You are summoned by the Council of Wizards...

{prompt}
   Most of the Wizards of the Council are also stricken with
disease and unable to attend.  The young Gandalph still looks
well and greets you.

    "As you know," he begins, "we have been experiencing an
unusual extended winter.  We have determined that this great
Winter is descending upon us from the north, and we believe
it to be a work of magic.  We suspect this to be the work of
the Ice Queen.  We have called you here to ask your help in
defeating her and saving us all from this raging blizzard."
