     You look around.  This is a simple hideout: one room,
one entrance, one passage.  A lantern is placed in the center
of the room.  On one side is Spirit sitting on a stone,
playing a harp, and Marcus on the floor, deeply mezmorized by
the lantern's flickering flame.

     Dilvish offers to teach you a spell called SHATTER.
''It allows you to freeze small objects, making them brittle
so that you can shatter them with a strong blow.''

Do you want to learn SHATTER?  (y/n)
