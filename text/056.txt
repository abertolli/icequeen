You encounter a dark clothed, disheveled elf who looks like
he's been spending just a little too much time with nature.

As you approach him, he tells you to halt.  You do so.
''Now, drop all your items,'' he commands.  Obviously a
nutcase.

Ahab the barkeep comes over, ''Don't be startin' any trouble
Blackthorn, or ya know what'll happen.''  He points over to
a hulking, half naked barbarian named Warf.  Warf grunts.

Blackthorn leaves you alone.
