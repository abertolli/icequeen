     You explain that you are not here to harm them, only
want to find out more information about the Ice Queen.  You
introduce yourself.

     ''My name is Dilvish,'' the elf tells you.  ''And these
are my friends, Prudence, Spirit, and Marcus.''  You greet
them all individually.  They go back to what they were doing
as Dilvish talks to you.

     ''I too am trying to defeat the Ice Queen.  I have not
found a way into the castle yet.  I hope that this will gain
my seat as the rightful heir to the throne of Gilantry back.
I married the princess Avena, but since she passed away, the
Council has done away with the throne.''  You get a sense of
sorrow in Dilvish's voice when he talks about Avena.
