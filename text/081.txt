The Wizards of Gilantry greet you warmly.

"We thank you for destroying the Ice Queen.
As promised, here is your reward."  They hand
you a bag of gold.

"We will be going to the Castle of the Winds
ourselves and sealing the entrance with magic
so her evil never has a chance to prosper again."


CONGRATULATIONS!
You have won the game.
