You find yourself among the partrons of the Elf Skull Inn, an outpost known
for cut-throats and bandits as well as the meanest and toughest mercenaries to
roam Gilantry. You don't want to pick a fight here. As you look around the
place you hear bouts of raoucous laughter in the sweaty, crowded bar room. You
look over at the bar where many drunk patrons have another round. Near the bar
you see people gambling at a crap table. Over in the corner you see a merchant
stand which seems to offer magical items. At the tables where the patrons
drink and swear, you also see competitions of knife throwing and arm wrestling.
Nearby is an unusual caged arena where an occasional challenge to the death is
made. There is also a stairway on the far side of the place that leads up into
rooms you may rent for the night, though it is rumored that bandits have
attacked many a traveler that cannot hold his own at the Elf Skull Inn. You
notice over near the stairway is a large barred door guarded by one of
Roland's Roving Jesters, dressed in red and yellow.
