     You follow him down a hallway with doors along both
sides.  These are the rooms for rent at the Elf Skull Inn.
You hear some loud grunting and other noises coming from some
of the rooms.  The elf enters a door at the very end.

    You go up to the door and listen, but hear nothing.  You
open the door just a little and notice that no one is in the
room.  However, the rug has been moved to reveal a trap door
in the floor.

    No sooner have you descended down the trap door when you
are surprised by the elf and his companions in their little
hideout.  ''What are you doing here?'' he demands.

Do you want to attack or speak to them?  (a/s)
