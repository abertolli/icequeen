~007
   Squirrels lift their heads in
attention.  Song birds fly near, 
responding to your summons.  People 
stop to look at your great skill with
animals.  The animals, frightened by 
the busy city, run off.
~

~008
   You invoke the Chant of Healing.
Immediately, the magic takes effect
and you feel better.
~

~009
   The Ring of Power glows for a moment
and nothing seems to happen.  You think
you hear wind chimes in the distance.
Faeries fade in and use their healing
powers on you.  They fade back before
you can thank them.
~

~010
   You are unable to fully control this
magic.  When you invoke the Ring of
Power, thorny vines erupt from the
ground and wrap themselves around your
legs.  You take damage and struggle
until you are finally free.
~

~011
   You invoke the Ring of Power.
People jump back as sparks fly from
your fingers.  A large cinder strikes
your eyes and you are temporarily
blinded.  When you regain your sight
people are staring.
~

~012
   You concentrate upon the Ring of
Power.  Suddenly, there is a ringing
and pain in your ears.  You lose your
balance and stumble to the ground.
Soon, the spell subsides and you regain
your feet.
~

~013
   You call upon the Ring of Power.  A
gust of wind blows, but your pretty
sure it would have anyway.  The magic
seems to have fizzled with no effect.
~

~014
   You pick up a small stone and cast
your spell.  The stone becomes frozen,
making it very brittle.  You crush it
easily.  This spell only works on small
objects.
~

~015
"I left a Magic Sword in a cave somewhere,
have you seen it?"
~

~016
"The Dark Knights ride again."
~

~017
"I hear there's a way to get free potions at the
magic shop."
~

~018
"The gates to the Castle of the Winds cannot be
opened.  A resourceful person will find another
way to get in."
~

~019
"If you win my Skull Dice game, I will teach you
an ancient dark spell to obliterate anything."
~

~020
"The Ice Queen can only be hurt by fire."
~

~021
"Have you ever played my Wheel of Fortune game?
Come visit the Elf Skull Inn, and I'll show you."
~

~022
"Some say a great red dragon lives to the west.
Whoever is brave enough to defeat it would surely
gain an invaluable prize."
~

~023
   You are temporarily transported to a
magical world where horses are born
with eagle wings.  Bees buzz around you
and don't sting.  A pure river cuts
right through this land of peace and
harmony.  After a few moments, you are
back to where you were before.
~

~024
   A bird lands on your shoulder and a
deer approaches.  You notice your
ability to befriend animals.  They will
bring you food when you need it and
help you as long as it doesn't put them
in great danger.  Even if they aren't
of much use, you appreciate the company.
~

~025
   If you haven't guessed by now, this
spell summons the aid of animals and
wildlife.  Using it here just doesn't
work.
~

~026
   Oh, sure.  Where would the world be
if everyone went around obliterating
everything?
~

~027
You cast the spell, and webs issue
forth from your hands.  You decorate
the walls and floor.  You decide this
spell would be best at halloween.
~

~028
     The Ring of Power glows, and magic
spreads over your entire body.  You
have the strange and sudden urge to
join Roland's band of Roving Jesters.
You dance around for a bit until the
magic wears off.
~

~029
     The fire of a mighty dragon issues
forth from your lips (which become dry
and chapped).  You incinerate a small
woodland creature.
~

~030
     It's a little hard to see, so you
breathe Dragon Fire to light up the
place.  Works good, but makes the walls
black.
~

~031
     You look around to make sure no
one is looking, then cast your Dragon
Breath spell.  You accidently incinerate
a nearby stand selling fruit.  You
quickly disappear down one of the alleys
before they notice you.
~

~032
     The Ring of Power opens your mind
to other planes of existance.  You hear
a threatening voice from the Netherworld
say, "I WILL GET YOU."  You are shaken
up, but after a while, you realize that
whoever it is isn't going to get you
right now.
~

~033
     The Ring of Power glows with a
soothing golden light... all your
wounds close up and you are healed
completely.
~

~034
You invoke the spell, and sure enough,
you become resistant to fire attacks.
~

~035
No sooner do you cast the spell when
you suddenly feel a warmness inside.
~

~036
A surge of valor flows through you when
you cast this spell.  You feel like
fighting more than ever.  You miss the
smell of blood in your nostrils.
~

~037
You skin takes on the bluish-white
hue of a glacier, and becomes hard and
resistant to attacks.
~

~038
A layer of thick ice forms in front of
you.  This is best used in battle.
~

~039
You find yourself among the partrons of the Elf Skull Inn, an outpost known
for cut-throats and bandits as well as the meanest and toughest mercenaries to
roam Gilantry. You don't want to pick a fight here. As you look around the
place you hear bouts of raoucous laughter in the sweaty, crowded bar room. You
look over at the bar where many drunk patrons have another round. Near the bar
you see people gambling at a crap table. Over in the corner you see a merchant
stand which seems to offer magical items. At the tables where the patrons
drink and swear, you also see competitions of knife throwing and arm wrestling.
Nearby is an unusual caged arena where an occasional challenge to the death is
made. There is also a stairway on the far side of the place that leads up into
rooms you may rent for the night, though it is rumored that bandits have
attacked many a traveler that cannot hold his own at the Elf Skull Inn. You
notice over near the stairway is a large barred door guarded by one of
Roland's Roving Jesters, dressed in red and yellow.
~

~040
"I hear Baltar will be fighting Damian in The Cage tonight.
It should be a great fight!"
~

~041
"The King of Couringlane has found a new wife.  He's marrying
a princess of the surrounding area."
~

~042
"I saw an enormous bird flying over near the Ice Queen's castle
yesterday!  It was as big as an elephant!"
~

~043
"I think Airk the Red could kick Pa-Kur's butt any day.  I'll
put 100 gold coins on that wager!"
~

~044
"Drolen told me this damned cold is really the work of the
wizards in Gilantry."
~

~045
"Some people from the south have come to destroy the Ice Queen.
Last I heard they were in Gilantry on their way up here."
~

~046
"Vernan was killed in his room last night by an undead creature."
~

~047
"That Gorgon's Milk is some fine liquer!  I'm going to have me
another."
~

~048
You notice a cloaked Elf sitting next to you, minding his own
business.  He gets up quietly and makes his way over to a door
on the other side of the room.

Do you wish to follow?  (y/n)
~

~049
     You follow him down a hallway with doors along both
sides.  These are the rooms for rent at the Elf Skull Inn.
You hear some loud grunting and other noises coming from some
of the rooms.  The elf enters a door at the very end.

    You go up to the door and listen, but hear nothing.  You
open the door just a little and notice that no one is in the
room.  However, the rug has been moved to reveal a trap door
in the floor.

    No sooner have you descended down the trap door when you
are surprised by the elf and his companions in their little
hideout.  "What are you doing here?" he demands.

Do you want to attack or speak to them?  (a/s)
~

~050
     You explain that you are not here to harm them, only
want to find out more information about the Ice Queen.  You
introduce yourself.

     "My name is Dilvish," the elf tells you.  "And these
are my friends, Prudence, Spirit, and Marcus."  You greet
them all individually.  They go back to what they were doing
as Dilvish talks to you.

     "I too am trying to defeat the Ice Queen.  I have not
found a way into the castle yet.  I hope that this will gain
my seat as the rightful heir to the throne of Gilantry back.
I married the princess Avena, but since she passed away, the
Council has done away with the throne."  You get a sense of
sorrow in Dilvish's voice when he talks about Avena.

{prompt}
     You look around.  This is a simple hideout: one room,
one entrance, one passage.  A lantern is placed in the center
of the room.  On one side is Spirit sitting on a stone,
playing a harp, and Marcus on the floor, deeply mezmorized by
the lantern's flickering flame.

     Dilvish offers to teach you a spell called SHATTER.
"It allows you to freeze small objects, making them brittle
so that you can shatter them with a strong blow."

Do you want to learn SHATTER?  (y/n)
~

~052
A fighter in dark armor bumps into you.  "Hey watch where
you're going."  Suddenly the people around you get silent.
You hear muttering.

Do you apologize and offer him a drink?  (y/n)

~

~053
You meet a woman named Elyra.  She is incredibly beautiful
with deep brown eyes and long hair as black as a moonless
night.  You buy her a drink.

"I miss Baltar," she says.
~

~054
You see someone fingering a copper coin inlaid with
different colored gems.  He tosses the coin around a bit.

You approach him asking about the coin.  "It's none of
your business," he answers.  However, he buys you a
drink.  You find out his name is Drolen, and you sit and
chat with him.  He has stolen many a goods in the elven
city of Elfhome.
~

~055
You notice a small halfling drinking at the bar with you.
He greets you warmly and introduces himself as Turis.  He
says he's been looking for his friend Dilvish ever since
they attacked the Illusionist's Tower.
~

~056
You encounter a dark clothed, disheveled elf who looks like
he's been spending just a little too much time with nature.

As you approach him, he tells you to halt.  You do so.
"Now, drop all your items," he commands.  Obviously a
nutcase.

Ahab the barkeep comes over, "Don't be startin' any trouble
Blackthorn, or ya know what'll happen."  He points over to
a hulking, half naked barbarian named Warf.  Warf grunts.

Blackthorn leaves you alone.
~

~057
You decide to sit and chat with a beautiful golden-haired
elf named Samantha.  She brags about how she was going to
marry the King of Couringlane but tricked him instead.

After she leaves, you make sure to check your pockets that
she didn't steal anything.
~

~058
You offer him a drink and he gladly accepts.  "Thanks man,
my name is Baltar."  He gives you a hardy handshake and
goes off to fight in The Cage.
~

~059
He pushes you.  "Do you even know who I am?" he asks.
You hear the crowd around you beginning to chant, "fight!
fight! fight!"

"Baltar challenges you to fight to the death in The
Cage!" shouts the fighter.

Do you accept the challenge?  (y/n)
~

~060
"Hahaha, you coward," laughs Baltar.  In fact, the whole
bar laughs at you.
~

~061
You enjoy your drink as you watch the scantilly dressed
dancers in The Cage.  Quite enticing.
~

~062
Shortly, there is a knock on the door.  You open the door
to one of the Elf Skull Inn's women.  She smiles as she
enters...
~

~063
About fifteen minutes into the night, the woman begins to
make strange gurgling noises.  You watch in horror as her
shape begins to change!  You quickly get up and ready 
yourself and your items.

The creature grows wings, becoming angelic and demonic at
once.  She is seductive but you stand your ground.  You
have heard of these creatures in stories:
     "My face became like that of the nightitself and my
limbs grew into those of seductive beasts.  ...With nary a
groan, I pierced his flesh with my talon-nails, gorging
on the gouts of blood that spurted from his wounds."

It attacks!
~

~064
You walk over to a crowd of people yelling and jeering at
a couple of neanderthals arm-wrestling at a table.  You
push your way through to watch.  They struggle for a few
minutes, but suddenly one gets the upper hand and wins.

Do you want to challenge the winner?  (y/n)
~

~065
You courageously walk over toward a group of thieves who
are practicing their knife-throwing skills at a target on
the wall.  They eye you suspiciously as you approach their
corner of the Elf Skull Inn.  "Care to try?" asks one
with a grin.

Do you accept the challenge?  (y/n)
~

~066
                           WHITE HEART: "Immortality"

                              MOON: "Ignorance"

                            You gain 1000 xp and gp.
~

~076

   As you open the cover of the dusty book, you take a look
at the pages.  The writing is like nothing you've ever seen
before, but somehow you are able to read it.  It is very
interesting...




   As you are reading, you don't notice that your body is
changing.  Before you know it, you have been turned into a
gold fish.  You flop around on the floor, feeling very dry.
You hope someone comes to put you in some water... but no
one does.
~

~077
A guard calls down to you, "Who goes there?"

"Let me in..." you manage.

"Hahahaha, yeah right,"  they laugh at you and point.


     What do you do?
        (B)eg them
        (O)ffer them something
        (C)ast a spell
        (L)eave
~

~078
You get down on your knees and beg them to let you in.

They just start lauging at you.  "Why on earth would we
let you in to begin with?  Be gone or we'll kill you."

They throw some snowballs at you.
~

~079
"I'll give you treasures and gold," you offer as you
try to entice them by appealing to their greed.

"And have our Queen Illfrith take our heads?  I don't
think I'd be able to enjoy all that gold after that!"
They both just laugh at you and shrug you off.
~

~080
What a glorious day!  You have killed the Ice Queen!

You decide to quickly go back to Gilantry City and
claim the reward you were offered.  You decide to
take the Ice Queen's head as proof of your deed.
But as you look through the doorway, you notice
her men are still in the castle...
~

~081
The Wizards of Gilantry greet you warmly.

"We thank you for destroying the Ice Queen.
As promised, here is your reward."  They hand
you a bag of gold.

"We will be going to the Castle of the Winds
ourselves and sealing the entrance with magic
so her evil never has a chance to prosper again."


CONGRATULATIONS!
You have won the game.
~

~blue
You quaff the blue potion.

You feel a surge of energy, as you
become fast and strong.  Soon, however,
the potion's effects wear off.  Maybe
you can find a better time to use it.
~

~green
You hold your nose and swallow the
green potion.

Suddenly you feel a revitalizing energy
fill your entire body.  All your wounds
are healed and you gain super-human
combat skill.  The latter effect wears
off in a few minutes.  This type of 
potion is most likely best used in 
battle.
~

~intro
   A chilling breeze comes from the north, reminding you of
the recent course of events:

   A bitter cold descended on the City of Gilantry about one
month after spring had started.  At first no one did more
than complain about the inconvenient weather.  But after weeks
passed, it soon became evident that there was something wrong.

   It seemed that only the city had been affected, and farms
to the south were still able to grow crops.  However, it
wasn't long before disease and depression began to afflict the
people.

You are summoned by the Council of Wizards...

{prompt}
   Most of the Wizards of the Council are also stricken with
disease and unable to attend.  The young Gandalph still looks
well and greets you.

    "As you know," he begins, "we have been experiencing an
unusual extended winter.  We have determined that this great
Winter is descending upon us from the north, and we believe
it to be a work of magic.  We suspect this to be the work of
the Ice Queen.  We have called you here to ask your help in
defeating her and saving us all from this raging blizzard."
~

~red
The red potion goes down easily.

It makes you feel better.  Soothing
healing fills your body and some of
your wounds are cured.
~
